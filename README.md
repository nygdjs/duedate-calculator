# ⏳ Due Date Calculator

A javascript application, that calculates due dates based on the submit date (current date and time by default) and a turnaround time (given in hours as a number) needed for the work to be done.

The application is intended to run in the browser (see list of compatible browsers in`package.json`s `"browserslist":` field).

## Prerequisities

You should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

## Getting started

Install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

To start the dev/webserver (also live-reloads changes), type in your terminal:

```bash
npm run start
```

It will automagically open up your default broser with the URL.
